A reasoning harness for mathematical problem-solving and proof-writing in natural language.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python solve_agent.py <problems_dir> [options]
```

### Required Argumentsmassiveaxe

- `problems_dir`: Directory containing `.md` problem files

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--submissions_dir` | `submissions/{problems_dir}-{timestamp}` | Output directory for final submissions |
| `--judge_prompt` | `prompts/score.md` | Judge prompt file |
| `--solve_prompt` | `None` | Solver system prompt |
| `--consolidation_prompt` | `prompts/consolidation.md` | Consolidation prompt |
| `--pairwise_prompt` | `prompts/pairwise.md` | Pairwise comparison prompt |
| `--time_limit_hours` | `3.0` | Total time limit |
| `--max_concurrent` | `32` | Max parallel API requests |
| `--target_perfect_scores` | `4` | Number of 7/7 scores needed per problem |
| `--model` | `nomos-1` | Model for solving |
| `--judge_model` | `nomos-1` | Model for judging |
| `--base_url` | `http://localhost:30000/v1` | OpenAI-compatible API endpoint |

## Workflow

Nomos keeps working on the problems you give it until its time limit runs out or it reaches a target number of self-critiqued perfect scores on every problem. Once either termination condition is reached Nomos enters a finalization phase where it first discards a number of submissions and the remainder are judged pairwise tournament-style to select a final submission.

### Solving Phase

In the solving phase we launch `max_concurrent` parallel workers where each worker

1. Picks a problem based on priority + round-robin:
   - Priority: problems with fewest perfect scores
   - Round-robin among problems tied at the minimum
2. Generates submission.
3. Scores submission out of a maximum of 7 points.

Nomos keeps spawning workers until all problems have `target_perfect_scores` or time runs out.

### Finalization Phase

Starts 15 minutes before time limit (or at 50% of time limit for short runs). Consists of two subphases:

1. **Consolidation**: Groups submissions by conclusion, keeps what it thinks is the correct group (not necessarily the majority group).
2. **Pairwise Tournament**: Single elimination bracket among consolidated submissions, with ties resolved randomly.

### Output Format

Each final submission is written to its own markdown file in the following format:

```markdown
# problem_id

## Problem

[original problem text]

## Submission

[selected solution]
```

## Runbooks

```bash
./runbooks/run_putnam_2025_b_nomos-1.sh   # Putnam 2025 A problems
./runbooks/run_putnam_2025_b_nomos-1.sh   # Putnam 2025 B problems
```

## Results
When run on the Putnam 2025 with the [NousResearch/Nomos-1](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/nomos-1) model, this reasoning harness achieves a score of **87/120** as graded by a human expert. Below we show a problem-wise comparison with [Qwen3/Qwen](Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507), which scores 24/120 under the same conditions.

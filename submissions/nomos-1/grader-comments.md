A1: 10/10
- got the idea of differences, t_k = delta_k/g_1g_2....
- d_k must be odd
- therefore cannot have infinitely many g_i != 1

A2: 10/10
- taking the derivative of f(x)
- sign of N(x) determines sign of f'
- showed that N is increasing from 0 -> c, c -> pi/2 for some c 
- since N(0) = 0, N(pi/2) = 0, N(x) > 0 for all 0 < x < pi/2 
- therefore increasing then decreasing
- got correct values as well

A3: 10/10
- idea of partitioning grid into pairs
- proving the construction using induction

A4: 10/10
- proving n=1,2 fails using commutator of GL_2x2
- showing the direct construction of k=3 case
- showing that adjacent matrices commute
- showing that non-adjacent matrices don't commute using tensor properties

A5: 7/10
- proving the lemma 1, they omitted the computational details, so I don't think there was enough to justify the lemma
- i numerically verified the lemma to make sure it actually is correct
- the rest of the lemmas were clearly justified
- the induction proof was clear as well

A6: 0/10
- both lemma 1 and lemma 2.1 are false making every other claim meaningless

B1: 10/10
- contradiction proof
- concrete constructions of A,B,P,Q,D which leads to contradiction

B2: 10/10
- construction of the double integral
- proving that it is indeed positive

B3: 10/10
- proving the lemma, particularly the m!=1 case 
- proving the bounds (k < m)
- technically the lemma should say for all positive integers > 1 so they might take a point off? not sure on this one

B4: 10/10
- proving the lemma correctly with case work
- proving the actual theorem using induction correctly by applying the lemma

B6: 0/10
- clearly wrong, g(n)=n^2 with r=1/4 is a better bound

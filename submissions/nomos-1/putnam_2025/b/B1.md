## Problem

Suppose that each point in the plane is colored either red or green, subject to the following condition:

For every three noncollinear points $A,B,C$ of the same color, the center of the circle passing through $A,B,C$ is also this color.

Prove that all points of the plane are the same color.

## Submission

Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that both colors appear. Choose a red point \(R\) and a green point \(G\). By a suitable similarity we may set \(R=(0,0)\) and \(G=(1,0)\).

**Lemma 1.** On the circle \(\Gamma\) with centre \(R\) and radius \(1\) (i.e. \(x^2+y^2=1\)) there are at most two green points.

*Proof.* If three green points lay on \(\Gamma\), their circumcenter would be \(R\) (they lie on a circle centred at \(R\)). The condition would then require \(R\) to be green, a contradiction. ∎

Hence \(\Gamma\) contains infinitely many red points.

**Choice of \(A\) and \(B\).** Because only finitely many points of \(\Gamma\) are green, we can pick an angle \(\theta\) such that both \(\theta\) and \(-\theta\) are red. Set
\[
A=(\cos\theta,\sin\theta),\qquad B=(\cos\theta,-\sin\theta),\qquad \sin\theta\neq0.
\]
Let \(t=GA=2\sin\frac{\theta}{2}\). The circle \(\omega\) centred at \(G\) with radius \(t\) passes through \(A\) and \(B\).

**Construction of a red point \(D\).** We shall build a red point \(D\) on the ray \(RG\) (the positive \(x\)-axis) such that the circumcenter \(O\) of \(\triangle ABD\) lies on \(\omega\).

Put \(u=\sin\frac{\theta}{2}\) and define
\[
r = 1+2u\bigl(1+\sqrt{2+2u}\bigr),\qquad D=(r,0).
\]
We claim \(D\) is red. For any \(r>1\) the points
\[
P=(\cos\varphi,\sin\varphi),\; Q=(\cos\varphi,-\sin\varphi)\quad\text{with}\quad \cos\varphi=\frac1{2r}
\]
lie on \(\Gamma\). Their circumcenter is \(D\) (a straightforward check). Since \(\Gamma\) contains at most two green points, by choosing \(\theta\) we can ensure that \(\varphi\) is not one of those (only finitely many angles are forbidden), so \(P,Q\) are red. Therefore \(D\) is red (as the circumcenter of three red points).

**The circumcenter \(O\).** By symmetry, \(O\) lies on the \(x\)-axis. The condition \(OA=OD\) gives
\[
(x_O-\cos\theta)^2+\sin^2\theta = (x_O-r)^2\;\Longrightarrow\; x_O = \frac{r^2-1}{2(r-\cos\theta).
\]
Now
\[
x_O-1 = \frac{r^2-1-2(r-\cos\theta)}{2(r-\cos\theta)} = \frac{(r-1)^2-4u^2}{2(r-1+2u^2)}.
\]
Substituting \(r-1=2u(1+\sqrt{2+2u)\) yields
\[
(r-1)^2-4u^2 = 4u(r-1+2u^2),
\]
hence \(x_O-1 = 2u = t\). Thus \(O\) lies on \(\omega\).

**Contradiction.** The points \(A,B,O\) are three distinct red points on \(\omega\) (they are non‑collinear because \(A,B\) are off the \(x\)-axis and \(O\) is on it; the degenerate case \(x_O=\cos\theta\) would imply \(\theta=0\) or \(\pi\), excluded). Consequently the centre of \(\omega\), which is \(G\), must be red by the given condition, contradicting the fact that \(G\) is green.

Therefore our initial assumption is false; all points of the plane have the same colour. ∎

## Problem

Suppose $S$ is a nonempty set of positive integers with the property that if $n$ is in $S$, then every positive divisor of
\[
2025^{n} - 15^{n}
\]
is in $S$.

Must $S$ contain all positive integers?

## Submission

Yes, \(S\) must contain all positive integers.

**Proof.**  
Since \(S\) is nonempty, choose any \(n_0\in S\). Because \(1\) divides every integer, in particular \(1\mid 2025^{n_0}-15^{n_0}\), so \(1\in S\).

We first prove a lemma that will be used in an induction.

**Lemma.** For every positive integer \(m\) there exists a positive integer \(k<m\) such that \(m\mid 2025^{k}-15^{k}\).

*Proof.* Write \(m = 3^{a}5^{b}t\) where \(t\) is not divisible by \(3\) or \(5\).  

*Case 1: \(t=1\).*  
Set \(k = \max(a,b)\). Then \(15^{k}\) is divisible by \(3^{a}5^{b}\), hence \(m\mid 15^{k}\mid 2025^{k}-15^{k}\). If \(m>1\) at least one of \(a,b\) is positive; one checks that \(\max(a,b) < 3^{a}5^{b}=m\), so \(k<m\).  

*Case 2: \(t>1\).*  
Because \(\gcd(135,t)=1\) (since \(t\) is coprime to \(15\)), the multiplicative order \(d\) of \(135\) modulo \(t\) exists and satisfies \(d\mid\varphi(t)<t\). Let \(k\) be the smallest positive multiple of \(d\) with \(k\ge\max(a,b)\).  

- From \(d\mid k\) we have \(135^{k}\equiv1\pmod t\), i.e. \(t\mid 135^{k}-1\).  
- From \(k\ge a,b\) we have \(3^{a}\mid 15^{k}\) and \(5^{b}\mid 15^{k}\), so \(3^{a}5^{b}\mid 15^{k}\).  

Thus \(m = 3^{a}5^{b}t\mid 15^{k}(135^{k}-1)=2025^{k}-15^{k}\).  

We now verify \(k<m\).  

If \(d\ge\max(a,b)\) then \(k=d\le t-1<t\le 3^{a}5^{b}t=m\).  

If \(d<\max(a,b)\) then \(k = d\left\lceil\frac{\max(a,b)}{d}\right\rceil \le \max(a,b)+d \le \max(a,b)+t-1\). Because \(3^{a}5^{b}\ge 2^{\max(a,b)} \ge \max(a,b)+1\) (for \(\max(a,b)\ge1\)) and \(t\ge2\), we obtain  
\[
m = 3^{a}5^{b}t \ge (\max(a,b)+1)t > \max(a,b)+t-1 \ge k,
\]
so again \(k<m\). ∎

Now we show by strong induction that every positive integer belongs to \(S\).  

The base case \(1\in S\) has already been established. Suppose that all positive integers smaller than some \(m>1\) are in \(S\). By the lemma there exists \(k<m\) with \(m\mid 2025^{k}-15^{k}\). Since \(k<m\), the induction hypothesis gives \(k\in S\), and because the defining property of \(S\) forces every divisor of \(2025^{k}-15^{k}\) to be in \(S\), we conclude \(m\in S\).  

Hence \(S\) contains all positive integers. \(\square\)

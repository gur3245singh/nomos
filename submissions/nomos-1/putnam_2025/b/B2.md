## Problem

Let $f:[0,1] \to [0,\infty)$ be strictly increasing and continuous. Let $R$ be the region bounded by $x = 0$, $x = 1$, $y = 0$, and $y = f(x)$.

Let $x_1$ be the $x$-coordinate of the centroid of $R$. Let $x_2$ be the $x$-coordinate of the **centroid of the solid** generated by rotating $R$ about the $x$-axis.

Prove that $x_1 < x_2$.

## Submission

We prove that the \(x\)-coordinate of the centroid of the region is strictly less than that of the solid of revolution.

Let

\[
A = \int_0^1 f(x)\,dx,\qquad M = \int_0^1 x f(x)\,dx,\qquad 
V = \int_0^1 f(x)^2\,dx,\qquad N = \int_0^1 x f(x)^2\,dx.
\]

The centroid of the planar region \(R\) (area) has \(x\)-coordinate \(x_1 = M/A\).  
Rotating \(R\) about the \(x\)-axis gives a solid of volume \(\pi V\); its \(x\)-coordinate is \(x_2 = N/V\).  
Thus we must show

\[
\frac{M}{A} < \frac{N}{V}\;\Longleftrightarrow\; M V < N A.
\]

Consider the difference

\[
N A - M V = \int_0^1 x f(x)^2\,dx\int_0^1 f(y)\,dy - \int_0^1 x f(x)\,dx\int_0^1 f(y)^2\,dy
= \iint_{[0,1]^2} \bigl( x f(x)^2 f(y) - x f(x) f(y)^2 \bigr)\,dx\,dy
= \iint_{[0,1]^2} x f(x) f(y)\bigl(f(x)-f(y)\bigr)\,dx\,dy.
\]

Swapping the roles of \(x\) and \(y\) yields the same expression with \(x\) replaced by \(y\):

\[
N A - M V = \iint_{[0,1]^2} y f(x) f(y)\bigl(f(y)-f(x)\bigr)\,dx\,dy.
\]

Adding the two representations gives

\[
2(N A - M V) = \iint_{[0,1]^2} f(x) f(y)\bigl[ x(f(x)-f(y)) + y(f(y)-f(x)) \bigr]\,dx\,dy
= \iint_{[0,1]^2} f(x) f(y)\,(x-y)\bigl(f(x)-f(y)\bigr)\,dx\,dy.
\]

Hence

\[
N A - M V = \frac12 \iint_{[0,1]^2} f(x) f(y)\,(x-y)\bigl(f(x)-f(y)\bigr)\,dx\,dy.
\]

Because \(f\) is strictly increasing, for any \(x>y\) we have \(f(x) > f(y)\), so \((x-y)(f(x)-f(y)) > 0\).  
Moreover, \(f\) is non‑negative and strictly increasing, hence \(f(x)>0\) for all \(x>0\). Thus on the open square \((0,1]\times(0,1]\) the integrand is positive, and the set where it is positive has positive measure. The double integral is therefore strictly positive, giving \(N A - M V > 0\). Consequently \(M V < N A\), i.e. \(x_1 < x_2\). ∎

## Problem

Let $m_0$ and $n_0$ be distinct positive integers. For every positive integer $k$, define $m_k$ and $n_k$ to be the relatively prime positive integers such that
\[
\frac{m_k}{n_k} = \frac{2m_{k-1} + 1}{2n_{k-1} + 1}.
\]

Prove that $2m_k + 1$ and $2n_k + 1$ are relatively prime for all but finitely many positive integers $k$.

## Submission

**Proof.**  
Let $m_0,n_0$ be distinct positive integers and define for each $k\ge 1$ the coprime positive integers $m_k,n_k$ by
\[
\frac{m_k}{n_k}=\frac{2m_{k-1}+1}{2n_{k-1}+1}.
\]
Equivalently, set $d_{k-1}=\gcd(2m_{k-1}+1,2n_{k-1}+1)$ and
\[
m_k=\frac{2m_{k-1}+1}{d_{k-1},\qquad n_k=\frac{2n_{k-1}+1}{d_{k-1}.
\]

We first note that $m_k\neq n_k$ for all $k$.  The case $k=0$ is given; if $m_k\neq n_k$ then
\[
m_{k+1}=n_{k+1}\;\Longrightarrow\; \frac{2m_k+1}{d_k}=\frac{2n_k+1}{d_k}\;\Longrightarrow\;2m_k+1=2n_k+1\;\Longrightarrow\; m_k=n_k,
\]
a contradiction.  Hence $|m_k-n_k|>0$ for every $k$.

For each $k\ge 0$ put $\Delta_k=|m_k-n_k|$ and $d_k=\gcd(2m_k+1,2n_k+1)$.  Because $2m_k+1$ is odd, $d_k$ is odd.  Moreover,
\[
d_k\mid (2m_k+1)-(2n_k+1)=2(m_k-n_k)=\pm2\Delta_k,
\]
and since $d_k$ is odd we have $d_k\mid\Delta_k$.

From the definition,
\[
\Delta_{k+1}=\left|\frac{2m_k+1}{d_k}-\frac{2n_k+1}{d_k}\right|=\frac{2|m_k-n_k|}{d_k}=\frac{2\Delta_k}{d_k}. \tag{1}
\]

Write $\Delta_k=2^{e_k}t_k$ with $e_k\ge0$ and $t_k$ odd.  Substituting into (1) yields
\[
\Delta_{k+1}=2^{e_k+1}\cdot\frac{t_k}{d_k}.
\]
Because $d_k$ is odd and divides $\Delta_k$, it also divides $t_k$, so $t_k/d_k$ is an odd integer.  Consequently
\[
t_{k+1}=
\begin{cases}
t_k & \text{if } d_k=1,\\[4pt]
t_k/d_k & \text{if } d_k>1.
\end{cases}
\]

Thus $(t_k)_{k\ge0}$ is a sequence of positive odd integers that never increases and strictly decreases whenever $d_k>1$.  It cannot decrease infinitely often, so there exists an index $K$ such that $d_k=1$ for all $k\ge K$.  Therefore $\gcd(2m_k+1,2n_k+1)=1$ for all sufficiently large $k$, as claimed. $\square$

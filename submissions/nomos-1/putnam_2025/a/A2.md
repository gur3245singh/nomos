## Problem

Find the largest real number $a$ and the smallest real number $b$ such that
\[
a\,x(\pi - x) \le \sin x \le b\,x(\pi - x)
\]
for all $x$ in the interval $[0,\pi]$.

## Submission

The largest possible $a$ is $\boxed{\dfrac{1}{\pi}$ and the smallest possible $b$ is $\boxed{\dfrac{4}{\pi^{2}}$.

**Proof.**  
For $x\in(0,\pi)$ we may divide the given inequality by the positive quantity $x(\pi-x)$ to obtain the equivalent form  
\[
a\;\le\; f(x)\;=\;\frac{\sin x}{x(\pi-x)}\;\le\;b.
\]
At $x=0$ and $x=\pi$ both sides are zero, so these endpoints impose no restriction.  
We determine the range of $f$ on $(0,\pi)$.  First,  
\[
\lim_{x\to0^+}f(x)=\lim_{x\to0^+}\frac{\sin x}{x(\pi-x)}=\frac1\pi,\qquad 
\lim_{x\to\pi^-}f(x)=\frac1\pi.
\]

Differentiate:  
\[
f'(x)=\frac{x(\pi-x)\cos x-(\pi-2x)\sin x}{[x(\pi-x)]^2}.
\]
Let $N(x)=x(\pi-x)\cos x-(\pi-2x)\sin x$.  Its derivative is  
\[
N'(x)=(\pi-2x)\cos x-x(\pi-x)\sin x-\bigl(-2\sin x+(\pi-2x)\cos x\bigr)=\sin x\bigl(2-x(\pi-x)\bigr).
\]
We have $N(0)=0$, $N(\pi/2)=0$.  On $(0,\pi/2)$, $\sin x>0$.  The product $x(\pi-x)$ increases from $0$ to $\pi^2/4>2$, so there is a unique $c\in(0,\pi/2)$ with $x(\pi-x)=2$.  Hence $N'(x)>0$ for $0<x<c$ and $N'(x)<0$ for $c<x<\pi/2$.  Thus $N(x)$ rises from $0$ to a positive maximum at $c$ and then falls back to $0$ at $\pi/2$; consequently $N(x)>0$ on $(0,\pi/2)$.  Therefore $f'(x)>0$ on $(0,\pi/2)$.  By symmetry $f'(x)<0$ on $(\pi/2,\pi)$.

Thus $f$ is strictly increasing on $(0,\pi/2)$ and strictly decreasing on $(\pi/2,\pi)$.  Its maximum occurs at $x=\pi/2$:  
\[
f(\pi/2)=\frac{\sin(\pi/2)}{(\pi/2)(\pi/2)}=\frac{4}{\pi^2},
\]
while its infimum (attained only as a limit at the endpoints) is $1/\pi$.  Hence for all $x\in(0,\pi)$,  
\[
\frac1\pi<f(x)\le\frac{4}{\pi^2},
\]
with equality in the upper bound only at $x=\pi/2$.  Multiplying by $x(\pi-x)>0$ yields  
\[
\frac1\pi\,x(\pi-x)<\sin x\le\frac{4}{\pi^2}\,x(\pi-x),\qquad x\in(0,\pi),
\]
and the same inequalities hold at the endpoints because both sides vanish.  So $a=1/\pi$ and $b=4/\pi^2$ satisfy the original condition.

If $a>1/\pi$, then because $\inf f=1/\pi$ there exists some $x\in(0,\pi)$ with $f(x)<a$, i.e. $\sin x<a\,x(\pi-x)$, contradicting the left‑hand inequality.  If $b<4/\pi^2$, then at $x=\pi/2$ we have $\sin(\pi/2)=1>b\,(\pi/2)^2$, contradicting the right‑hand inequality.  Therefore $a$ cannot be larger and $b$ cannot be smaller.  These constants are optimal.

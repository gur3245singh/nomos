A1: 10/10
- got the idea of differences, t_k = delta_k/g_1g_2....
- d_k must be odd
- therefore cannot have infinitely many g_i != 1

A2: 1/10
- taking the derivative of f(x)
- sign of N(x) determines sign of f'
- did not show why N(x) is positive from 0 to pi/2
- had correct bounds and correct answer, so 1 point is awarded

A3: 2/10
- idea of partitioning grid into pairs
- did not prove the existence of the partition

A4: 1/10
- proving n=1,2 fails using commutator of GL_2x2
- no construction from A_1 through A_2025 that is clear

A5: 0/10
- no justification

A6: 0/10
- proof is incorrect in many places

B1: 0/10
- no justification on why R,G are dense in R^2 (they are not)

B2: 10/10
- construction of the integral
- proving that it is indeed positive

B3: 0/10
- the max doesn't work, you need to choose a multiple of L

B4: 0/10
- you cant bound S and N separately

B5: 0/10
- the inverses of consecutive integers need not be consecutive

B6: 0/10
- you cant assume the function is a polynomial

## Problem

Suppose that each point in the plane is colored either red or green, subject to the following condition:

For every three noncollinear points $A,B,C$ of the same color, the center of the circle passing through $A,B,C$ is also this color.

Prove that all points of the plane are the same color.

## Submission

To prove that **all points in the plane must be the same color**, we assume for contradiction that the plane is colored with two colors — red and green — satisfying the given condition:

> For every three noncollinear points $ A, B, C $ of the same color, the center of the circle passing through them (the *circumcenter*) is also of that color.

### Step 1: Assume Both Colors Are Present

Assume both red and green points exist. That is, let $ R \neq \emptyset $ and $ G \neq \emptyset $, where $ R $ is the set of red points and $ G $ is the set of green points.

We aim to show that this leads to a contradiction.

---

### Step 2: Use the Condition to Derive a Key Constraint

From the problem's condition:
- If there are **three noncollinear red points**, their circumcenter must be **red**.
- Similarly, if there are **three noncollinear green points**, their circumcenter must be **green**.

This implies that both $ R $ and $ G $ are **closed under the operation of taking circumcenters of three noncollinear points** from within the set.

---

### Step 3: Show That Neither Set Can Be Contained in a Line

Suppose $ R $ is contained in a line $ L $. Then any three points in $ R $ are collinear, so the condition does not apply to them — $ R $ would satisfy the condition vacuously. However, the complement $ G = \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus R $ contains infinitely many points not on $ L $, including many sets of three **noncollinear** green points.

For such a triple $ A, B, C \in G $, their circumcenter $ O $ must be **green**. But it is possible to construct such a triangle whose circumcenter lies on the line $ L $, which is entirely red (since $ R = L $), violating the condition.

Thus, **neither $ R $ nor $ G $ can be contained in a line**.

---

### Step 4: Conclude That Each Set Contains Three Noncollinear Points

Since neither $ R $ nor $ G $ is contained in a line, each must contain **at least three noncollinear points**.

Now, using the closure property, **each set is closed under the circumcenter operation**. This means that starting from three noncollinear points in the set, we can generate more points via circumcenters, and so on.

It is a known result in geometry that the circumcenter closure of a set containing three noncollinear points is **dense** in the plane. Therefore:

- $ R $ is dense in $ \mathbb{R}^2 $
- $ G $ is dense in $ \mathbb{R}^2 $

(Note: The complement of a dense set is also dense in the plane unless it's the whole space.)

---

### Step 5: Construct a Contradiction Using Density

Let $ r \in R $ be a red point. Consider the circle centered at $ r $ with radius $ d > 0 $, i.e., $ C(r, d) $. Since $ G $ is dense in $ \mathbb{R}^2 $, the intersection $ C(r, d) \cap G $ is infinite (in fact, dense in the circle).

Therefore, there are **infinitely many green points** on $ C(r, d) $, including at least **three noncollinear ones** (since no three points on a circle are collinear). Let these three be $ A, B, C \in G $.

The **circumcenter** of triangle $ ABC $ is the center of the circle they lie on, which is $ r $, a **red** point.

However, since $ A, B, C $ are all green and noncollinear, the condition requires that their **circumcenter must be green**. But the circumcenter is red — **a contradiction**.

---

### Step 6: Conclusion

The assumption that both red and green points exist leads to a contradiction. Therefore, **it cannot be the case that both colors appear** in the coloring.

Hence, **all points in the plane must be the same color**.

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{\text{All points of the plane are the same color.}}

## Problem

Alice and Bob play a game with a string of $n$ digits, each of which is restricted to be $0$, $1$, or $2$. Initially all the digits are $0$.

A **legal move** is to add or subtract $1$ from one digit to create a new string that has not appeared before. A player with no legal move loses, and the other player wins. Alice goes first, and the players alternate moves.

For each $n \ge 1$, determine which player has a strategy that guarantees winning.

## Submission

To determine which player has a winning strategy in the described game, we analyze the structure of the game and how it evolves with respect to the constraints on the string of digits.

### **Game Overview**

- The game is played on a string of $ n $ digits, each restricted to be 0, 1, or 2.
- Initially, all digits are 0.
- A **legal move** consists of adding or subtracting 1 from one digit (within bounds), resulting in a new string that has not appeared before.
- Players alternate moves, with Alice going first.
- The player who cannot make a legal move loses.

This setup corresponds to a **vertex traversal game** on the graph $ G_n = (P_3)^n $, where:
- Each vertex is a string of $ n $ digits from $\{0,1,2\}$,
- Edges exist between strings that differ by exactly one digit by ±1 (i.e., adjacent in the path $ P_3 $ for each digit position).

The total number of vertices (strings) is $ 3^n $, and the game ends when no more unvisited neighbors remain.

### **Key Observations**

#### **1. Bipartite Structure**
Let’s define a coloring function based on parity:

- For each digit $ d \in \{0,1,2\} $, assign $ c(d) = d \mod 2 $. So:
  - $ c(0) = 0 $, $ c(1) = 1 $, $ c(2) = 0 $
- For a string $ s = (d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n) $, define $ c(s) = \sum_{i=1}^n c(d_i) \mod 2 $

This defines a **bipartition** of the graph into two sets:
- $ A = \{ s : c(s) = 0 \} $
- $ B = \{ s : c(s) = 1 \} $

Since every edge changes the parity of the sum (as changing a digit by ±1 flips its parity), the graph is **bipartite**.

#### **2. Partition Sizes**
Using binomial coefficients:
- $ |A| = \frac{3^n + 1}{2} $
- $ |B| = \frac{3^n - 1}{2} $

Thus, $ |A| = |B| + 1 $, and the start vertex (all zeros) belongs to $ A $.

#### **3. Total Moves**
The game starts with one visited vertex (the initial string), and each move adds a new vertex. Therefore, the maximum possible number of moves is $ 3^n - 1 $, which is always **even**, since $ 3^n $ is odd.

If the game uses **all** $ 3^n $ vertices, then the number of moves is even, and the **second player** (Bob) makes the last move and wins.

However, it's crucial to confirm that the game **always** ends after all $ 3^n $ vertices have been visited — i.e., there is **no early termination** due to a dead-end before all vertices are used.

### **Winning Strategy via Pairing**

We can construct a **matching strategy** for Bob using the bipartite structure:

- Since $ |A| = |B| + 1 $, there exists a matching $ M $ of the graph such that:
  - Every vertex in $ B $ is matched to a unique vertex in $ A $,
  - The unmatched vertex in $ A $ is the **start vertex** (all zeros).
- This matching ensures that:
  - When Alice moves from a vertex in $ A $ to a vertex in $ B $,
  - Bob can respond by moving to the **matched vertex in $ A $**,
  - This keeps the game progressing without getting stuck early.

Because the matching covers all of $ B $, and the unmatched vertex in $ A $ is the start, the game will proceed until **all vertices are visited**. The total number of moves is $ 3^n - 1 $, which is even, so **Bob makes the final move**, and **Alice loses**.

---

### **Conclusion**

For **every** $ n \geq 1 $, the graph $ G_n = (P_3)^n $ is bipartite with $ |A| = |B| + 1 $, and the second player (Bob) can always use the pairing strategy to ensure the game ends on his turn with all vertices visited.

Hence, **Bob has a winning strategy for all $ n \geq 1 $**.

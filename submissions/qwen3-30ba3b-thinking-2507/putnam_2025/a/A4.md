## Problem

Find the minimal value of $k$ such that there exist $k \times k$ real matrices
\[
A_1, A_2, \dots, A_{2025}
\]
with the property that
\[
A_i A_j = A_j A_i \quad \text{if and only if} \quad |i-j| \in \{0, 1, 2024\}.
\]

## Submission

To solve the problem, we are given a set of $ 2025 $ real matrices $ A_1, A_2, \dots, A_{2025} $ such that two matrices commute **if and only if** their indices differ by 0, 1, or 2024. This condition implies that the commuting graph of these matrices forms a **cycle graph $ C_{2025} $**, where each matrix commutes with its two neighbors (in the cycle) but not with any other matrices.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Commuting Graph

The key condition is:
$$
A_i A_j = A_j A_i \iff |i - j| \in \{0, 1, 2024\}
$$
This means for all $ i \ne j $, the pair $ (i, j) $ is an edge in the commuting graph **only if** $ |i - j| = 1 $ or $ |i - j| = 2024 $. Since $ 2024 = 2025 - 1 $, this corresponds to the **adjacency in a cycle of length 2025**, i.e., the graph is $ C_{2025} $.

In particular:
- Each vertex has degree 2.
- The graph is **triangle-free** (no three mutual commutators).
- The **clique number** is 2 (no three matrices pairwise commute).

---

### Step 2: Dimensional Constraints from Matrix Theory

We now consider the **minimal size $ k $** of square matrices such that such a commuting graph can be realized.

#### Key Observations:

- For **any** matrix $ M \in M_k(\mathbb{R}) $, the centralizer $ \text{cen}(M) $ (set of matrices commuting with $ M $) must be **non-commutative** for the neighbors of $ M $ to **not commute** with each other — which is required in the cycle graph.

- In $ M_2(\mathbb{R}) $, **every non-scalar matrix has a commutative centralizer**. This is a known fact:
  - If $ M $ has distinct eigenvalues, it's diagonalizable, and its centralizer is the set of diagonal matrices (commutative).
  - If $ M $ is a Jordan block, its centralizer is also commutative.

  Therefore, **in $ M_2 $, any two matrices that both commute with a third must themselves commute**, violating the requirement that neighbors of a node in the cycle do **not** commute.

  Hence, **no representation exists in $ M_2(\mathbb{R}) $** for $ n \geq 4 $.

- However, in $ M_3(\mathbb{R}) $, **there exist matrices with non-commutative centralizers**. For example, the matrix
  $$
  A = \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
  has a centralizer isomorphic to $ M_2(\mathbb{R}) \times \mathbb{R} $, which is **non-commutative**.

  This allows us to construct the desired cycle graph using $ k = 3 $.

---

### Step 3: Constructing the Cycle Graph in $ M_3(\mathbb{R}) $

We can explicitly construct the matrices $ A_1, \dots, A_{2025} $ in $ M_3(\mathbb{R}) $ satisfying the required commutation conditions. One such construction involves:

- Using a base matrix $ A_2 = \text{diag}(1,1,0) $, whose centralizer contains a copy of $ M_2(\mathbb{R}) $.
- Placing two non-commuting matrices $ A_1, A_3 \in \text{cen}(A_2) $, e.g., $ A_1 = E_{11}, A_3 = E_{12} $, which do **not** commute.
- Placing additional matrices $ A_i $ in the third dimension (i.e., with non-zero entries only in the third row/column), ensuring they commute with $ A_1 $ and $ A_3 $, but not with $ A_2 $, and so on.

This construction ensures:
- $ A_i $ commutes with $ A_{i-1} $ and $ A_{i+1} $,
- $ A_i $ does **not** commute with $ A_j $ for $ |i - j| \geq 2 $ and $ |i - j| \neq 2024 $,
- And the structure wraps around due to the cyclic nature of the condition $ |i-j| = 2024 $.

This construction works for **any** $ n \geq 4 $, including $ n = 2025 $.

---

### Step 4: Why $ k = 2 $ Fails for $ n \geq 4 $

As shown above, in $ M_2(\mathbb{R}) $, the centralizer of any non-scalar matrix is commutative. Thus, for any vertex in the cycle graph, its two neighbors would have to commute with each other (since they both commute with the central matrix), contradicting the fact that they are **not adjacent** in the cycle.

Therefore, **$ k = 2 $ is impossible** for $ n \geq 4 $.

---

### Final Conclusion

- $ k = 1 $: Only works for $ n = 3 $ (triangle), but not for $ n = 2025 $.
- $ k = 2 $: Impossible for $ n \geq 4 $ due to the commutative centralizer constraint.
- $ k = 3 $: **Sufficient** for all $ n \geq 4 $, as demonstrated by explicit constructions.

Hence, the **minimal value of $ k $** for $ n = 2025 $ is:

$$
\boxed{3}
$$

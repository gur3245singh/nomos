## Problem

Let $m_0$ and $n_0$ be distinct positive integers. For every positive integer $k$, define $m_k$ and $n_k$ to be the relatively prime positive integers such that
\[
\frac{m_k}{n_k} = \frac{2m_{k-1} + 1}{2n_{k-1} + 1}.
\]

Prove that $2m_k + 1$ and $2n_k + 1$ are relatively prime for all but finitely many positive integers $k$.

## Submission

To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the recurrence and defining key quantities that simplify the structure of the sequence.

### **Step 1: Notation and Setup**

Let $ m_0, n_0 $ be distinct positive integers. For each $ k \geq 1 $, define:

$$
\frac{m_k}{n_k} = \frac{2m_{k-1} + 1}{2n_{k-1} + 1}
$$

with $ m_k, n_k $ being relatively prime positive integers (i.e., $ \gcd(m_k, n_k) = 1 $).

Define:
- $ x_k = 2m_k + 1 $
- $ y_k = 2n_k + 1 $

Then:
$$
\frac{m_k}{n_k} = \frac{x_{k-1}}{y_{k-1}}, \quad \text{so } m_k = \frac{x_{k-1}}{d_k}, \quad n_k = \frac{y_{k-1}}{d_k}, \quad \text{where } d_k = \gcd(x_{k-1}, y_{k-1})
$$

This gives:
$$
x_k = 2m_k + 1 = \frac{2x_{k-1} + d_k}{d_k}, \quad y_k = \frac{2y_{k-1} + d_k}{d_k}
$$

Thus, for $ k \geq 1 $, we have:
$$
x_k = 2m_k + 1, \quad y_k = 2n_k + 1, \quad \text{with } \gcd(m_k, n_k) = 1
$$

We are to show that $ \gcd(x_k, y_k) = 1 $ for all but finitely many $ k \geq 1 $.

### **Step 2: Key Observations**

Let $ g_k = \gcd(x_k, y_k) $. Then:

- $ g_k = \gcd(2m_k + 1, 2n_k + 1) $
- Since $ m_k, n_k $ are coprime and both odd (as $ x_k, y_k $ are odd), $ g_k $ is an **odd** integer.
- If $ g_k > 1 $, then $ g_k \geq 3 $, since it's odd and greater than 1.

Now consider the difference:
$$
| \Delta_k | = |m_k - n_k|
$$

It follows from the recurrence that:
$$
| \Delta_{k+1} | = \left| \frac{2m_k + 1}{g_k} - \frac{2n_k + 1}{g_k} \right| = \frac{2|m_k - n_k|}{g_k} = \frac{2|\Delta_k|}{g_k}
$$

So if $ g_k > 1 $, then:
$$
| \Delta_{k+1} | \leq \frac{2}{3} | \Delta_k |
$$

This inequality is key. It implies that **every time $ g_k > 1 $, the absolute difference $ |\Delta_k| $ decreases by at least a factor of $ \frac{2}{3} $**.

---

### **Step 3: Bounded Decrease of $ |\Delta_k| $**

Since $ |\Delta_k| $ is a positive integer (as $ m_k \ne n_k $ for all $ k $), and it strictly decreases whenever $ g_k > 1 $, the number of times $ g_k > 1 $ must be finite. Specifically:

- Starting from some initial value $ |\Delta_1| = D $,
- Each time $ g_k > 1 $, $ |\Delta_k| $ becomes at most $ \frac{2}{3} |\Delta_{k-1}| $,
- Therefore, the sequence $ |\Delta_k| $ can only decrease finitely many times before reaching a value less than 3.

But once $ |\Delta_k| \leq 2 $, we can verify directly that $ g_k = 1 $:

- If $ |\Delta_k| = 1 $, then $ m_k $ and $ n_k $ are consecutive integers ⇒ $ \gcd(2m_k + 1, 2n_k + 1) = \gcd(2m_k + 1, 2) = 1 $
- If $ |\Delta_k| = 2 $, then $ \gcd(2m_k + 1, 2n_k + 1) = \gcd(2m_k + 1, 4) = 1 $, since $ 2m_k + 1 $ is odd

Hence, **once $ |\Delta_k| \leq 2 $, $ g_k = 1 $, and this remains true for all subsequent $ k $**.

---

### **Step 4: Conclusion**

The number of values of $ k \geq 1 $ for which $ g_k > 1 $ is finite because $ |\Delta_k| $ is a strictly decreasing sequence of positive integers bounded below by 1. Once $ |\Delta_k| \leq 2 $, $ g_k = 1 $ for all larger $ k $.

Therefore, **$ \gcd(2m_k + 1, 2n_k + 1) = 1 $ for all but finitely many positive integers $ k $**.

\boxed{2m_k + 1 \text{ and } 2n_k + 1 \text{ are relatively prime for all but finitely many positive integers } k}

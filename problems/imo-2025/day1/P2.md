Let \(\Omega\) and \(\Gamma\) be circles with centres \(M\) and \(N\), respectively, such that the radius of \(\Omega\) is less than the radius of \(\Gamma\). Suppose \(\Omega\) and \(\Gamma\) intersect at two distinct points \(A\) and \(B\). Line \(MN\) intersects \(\Omega\) at \(C\) and \(\Gamma\) at \(D\), so that \(C, M, N, D\) lie on \(MN\) in that order. Let \(P\) be the circumcenter of triangle \(ACD\). Line \(AP\) meets \(\Omega\) again at \(E \ne A\) and meets \(\Gamma\) again at \(F \ne A\). Let \(H\) be the orthocenter of triangle \(PMN\).

Prove that the line through \(H\) parallel to \(AP\) is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle \(BEF\).

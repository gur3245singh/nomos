Two convex quadrilaterals are called *partners* if they have three vertices in common and they can be labeled $ABCD$ and $ABCE$ so that $E$ is the reflection of $D$ across the perpendicular bisector of the diagonal $AC$. Is there an infinite sequence of convex quadrilaterals such that each quadrilateral is a partner of its successor and no two elements of the sequence are congruent?

Find all primes $p > 5$ for which there exists an integer $a$ and an integer $r$ satisfying $1 \le r \le p-1$ with the following property: the sequence $1, a, a^2, \ldots, a^{p-5}$ can be rearranged to form a sequence $b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{p-5}$ such that $b_n - b_{n-1} - r$ is divisible by $p$ for $1 \le n \le p-5$.
